# VEX-XY-Plotter
A VEX Cotrex-based XY plotter that will be able to plot both points and graph functions

This is more of a side project I am working on to improve my skills and knowledge base with robot C, in preparation for this year's VEX robotics competition and to help some of the incoming freshman who will be joining us. Feel free to modify or improve upon the code.
